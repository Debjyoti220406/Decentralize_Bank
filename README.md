# 🏦 Decentralized Smart Bank (Celo Testnet)

A simple **decentralized banking system** built with Solidity that allows users to **record deposits and withdrawals** directly on the blockchain.  
This project demonstrates how traditional financial actions (like saving and withdrawing money) can be **transparently executed on-chain** using smart contracts.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Decentralized Bank (SmartBank)** is a smart contract deployed on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**.  
It enables users to:
- Record deposits securely on-chain  
- Record withdrawals with full transaction transparency  
- Maintain immutable financial history for all users  

This is a **beginner-friendly smart contract** project showing how decentralized financial applications (DeFi) can be developed without centralized intermediaries.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Deploy the contract** using Remix with the Celo Sepolia network connected via MetaMask.  
2. **Deposit funds** by calling the deposit function.  
3. **Withdraw funds** with the withdrawal function.  
4. Each transaction is **recorded permanently on-chain** and can be verified through Blockscout.
